Encryption Module
Welcome to Encryption Module, a Python package that takes encryption beyond simple ciphers. This module uses matrix transformations and rotations to secure text in a way that is both unique and difficult to break. It is designed to be easy for developers to use while incorporating strong security measures.

Why Use This?
Enhanced Security – Uses matrix-based transformations and randomized reflection to make encryption more unpredictable.

Randomized Keys – Each encryption instance generates a new system-generated key, ensuring that encryption is never repeated the same way.

Easy to Use – Simple functions for encryption and decryption, with no complex setup.

Secure Key Storage – The encryption key is never hardcoded and is managed through environment variables for added protection.
